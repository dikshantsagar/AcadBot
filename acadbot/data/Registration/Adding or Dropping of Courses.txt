A  student  can  change  the  courses  that  he/she  does  in  a  semester  by  adding  and  dropping courses till the last date  for add/drop as specified in the  academic  calendar.  In addition, a student can withdraw from at most one elective course up to the last date  specified in the academic calendar, which will normally be after the mid-semester examination. During the summer term, a student may be permitted to drop one course by the late drop date.
