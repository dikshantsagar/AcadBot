)The  semester  performance  is  indicated  by  a  Semester  Grade  Point  Average  (SGPA) which is a weighted sum of all the points  earned  in the courses done in  a  semester. The SGPA is given for each semester and is computed using the following formula.SGPA = (u1.w1+ u2.w2+ ... + un.wn) / (u1+u2+ ... + un)where uiis the number of credits for the course iand wiis the points earned through the letter  grade  in  that  course,  and nis  the  number  of  courses  taken  in  the  semester.  While doing  the  computation  of  SGPA,the  course/thesis  credits  with  grades  S  and  X  are ignored.(2)The  overall  performance  is  indicated  by  a  Cumulative  Grade  Point  Average  (CGPA) which  is  computed  in  the  same  manner  as  the  computation  of  SGPA  but  for  all  the courses done in the program.  ‘F’ grade shall not be counted in the calculation of CGPA, however, it is counted in the calculation of SGPA.(3)The grades in courses will be announced over ERP at the end of every semester. A grade report  for  the  semester may  be issued  to astudent  after  the  semesterupon  request.  The grade  report  may  be  withheld  if  the  student  has  not  paid  the  fees  or  other  dues,  has  a disciplinary case pending against him/her, has not completed other formalities, or for any other pertinent reason.
