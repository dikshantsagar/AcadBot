Transfer of B.Tech. studentsfrom one program to the other ispossible only after the grades of the firstsemester are out. This is the only time branch change will occur. A student must make an explicit request to be considered for program transferwithin in a week from the date of announcementof resultsof the first semester. In his/her request, the student can mention more than one program in the order of preference. Rules for program transfer are: 1.Only  the  students  who  satisfy  eligibility  for  a  particular  branch  at  the  time  of  admission are eligible for transfer to thatbranch.2.Students  admitted  through  AICTE  need  to  produce  NOC  from  AICTE  if  applying  for transfer to anotherprogram.3.Students must have passed all credits specified for the first semester of the B.Tech.program.4.To be eligible for transfer to Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), Computer Science and  Applied  Mathematics  (CSAM)  or  Computer  Science  and  Design  (CSD)  program  or Computer  Science  and  Social  Sciences  (CSSS)  programor  Computer  Science  and Biosciences(CSB)  program,  a  student  must  have  received a  B  or  better  grade  in Introduction to Programming(IP)and Mathematics-I.5.To be eligible for transfer to Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) program, a student must have received a B or better grade in both Digital Circuits and Mathematics-I.Students eligible for program transfer will be ordered in a priority list based on CGPA and will be granted transfer in order as long as the strength of each program does not violate the followinglimits.6.The  base  strength  of  a  program  for  a  batch  will  be  the  number  of  students  who  were admitted  and  who  are  still  enrolled  in  the  program  as  on Dec 15  (after  Sem  1)  after completion  of  one  semester,  not  counting  those  who  were  repeating  the  first  year.  (E.g. Suppose  110  students  were  admitted  in  a  batch  and  there  were  8  repeaters.  If  6  of  the admitted students dropped out before Dec 15, then the base strength will  be 110-6=104).The final strength of any program shall not reduce by more than 10% of its base strength. Also,  the  final  strength  of  any  program  shall  not  increase  by  more  than  10%  of  its  basestrength.?Repeaters who are repeating first  year are also allowed branch transfer under the above-mentioned rules.?In case of a tie in CGPA of students, below tie breaking rules will be followed for deciding transfer from one branch to another
Tie Breaking Rule I -For transfer to CSE, CSAM, CSD, CSSS and CSB branches, higher grade in the order of Introduction to Programming, Maths-I, System Management, Digital Circuits, Communication SkillsTie Breaking Rule II -Higher JEE Rank
