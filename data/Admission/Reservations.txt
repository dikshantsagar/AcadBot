The  current  reservation  policy  (decided  by  the  Board  of  Governors)  of  the Institute largely  reflects  the  policy  of  Delhi  Government.  Currently,  85%  of  the seats  are  reserved  for  Delhi  candidates  (i.e.  those  who  have  completed  class  XII from  a  school/college/institute  located  in  Delhi),  and  15%  for  outside  Delhi candidates.   Category-wise   reservation   is   provided   within   these   limits,   as explained in the prospectus for each year.
