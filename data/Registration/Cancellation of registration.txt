A  student  is  solely  responsible  to  ensure  that  all  conditions  for  proper  registration  are satisfied,  and  there  are  no  timetable  clashes.  The  registration  may  be  cancelled  bytheDOAA for a course if any irregularity is found at a later stage.  A student’s registration for the  semester  may  be  cancelled  as  part  of  disciplinary  action.  Leave  beyond  permissible limits may also result in cancellation of registration for a semester.
