A  student  has  a  backlog  if  he/she  has  not  taken  or  has  taken  but  failed  in  course(s)  of previous  semester(s).  The  registration  of  such  a  student  must  be  approved  by  the  DOAA who will advise the student. Generally, the student should register in a manner that he/she can clear as many backlog courses as are available.
