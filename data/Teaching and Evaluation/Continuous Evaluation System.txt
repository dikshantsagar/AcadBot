(1)The  Institute  follows  a  system  of  continuous  evaluation,  in  which,  during  a  course, various  instruments  like  tests,  exams,  assignments,  projects,etc.,are  given  by  the instructor  to  assess  the  learning  of  students  and  assign  grades.  All  evaluations  are  the responsibility  of  the  instructor  in-charge  of  the  course.  The  two  main  exams –the  mid-semesterexam  and  the  end-semester  exam –shall  normally  be  scheduled  as  per  the academic calendar while the schedule of the rest will be decided by the Instructor. For 1 or  2  credit  courses,  the  Instructor  will  decide  the  evaluation  criteria  and  the  schedule  of tests and exams.(2)Make-up Exam:If a student, for valid reasons such as illness, etc., fails to appear in the end-semester  examination  in  one  or  more  course(s),  he/she  may  make  a  request  to  the instructorand the academic officefor a make-up examination within two days of the date of  the  scheduled  examination.Such  a  request  must,  however,  be  supported  by  proper documentary  evidence  for  justifying  the  request.  For  medical  reasons, only  two  medical applicationsincludingmid-semester  and  end-semesterwould  be  acceptedfor  make-up examinationsduring the entire duration of the B.Tech.degree completion. Further, for the grant of medical leave,studentsare requiredto upload the medical certificate within five working days from the date of the missed examination.  The Institute reserves the right to get the  medical  certificate  verifiedfrom  theInstitute  Doctor. Finally,  the  request  for make-up examinationwill be approved by the DOAA
