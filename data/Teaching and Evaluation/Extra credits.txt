B.Tech. students are allowed to do “extra credits" beyond 156 credits required for completion of B.Tech. requirement. For N extra  credits done, the student will be allowed worst grades in N credits, with a maximum limit of at most 8 credits, to be  not  counted  towards  CGPA  computation.  The  impact  of  this  decision  will  be reviewed  after  two  batches  have  graduated  with  this  option.  Following  method will be used for calculating the CGPA:Method: The below method will automatically decide which extra credits will not be counted in CGPA:
12?For CGPA computation at the end of 6th semester, baseline credits will be 116(equal to 29 full courses including OCbut excluding SG & CW). If a student has done N credits more than 116,then for CGPA computation the following will be done:-The worst grades in courses totaling M credits will be "removed", where M=min{8, N}. -CGPA  will  be  computed  based  on  the  remaining  credits.  It  is  to  be  noted  thatsince OC’sare with S/X Grades, although they will be included in baseline 116credits, they will not be counted in CGPA. For example,if a student has done 120 credits including OC  of  4  credits,  CGPA  will  be  computed  from  best  grades  corresponding  to112 credits.?For  CGPA  computation  at  the  end  of  7th  semester,  baseline  credits  will  be  136(including OC but excluding SG & CW).?CGPA  computation  for  Honors  students  at  the  end  of  8thsemester  will  done similar to a non-Honors student,i.e.,he will be allowed to not-count worst grades of  courses  upto  8  credits. For  example,if  a  student  has  done  164  credits (excluding  SG/CW  credits)  including  OC  of  4  credits,  CGPA  will  be  computed from best grades corresponding to 152 credits.
